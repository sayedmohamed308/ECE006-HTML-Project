    <td>Emergence</td>
    <td>AI is an advancement made by human insights; its early improvement is credited to Norbert Weiner who theorized on criticism mechanisms.</td>
    <td>On the other hand, human creatures are made with the intrinsic capacity to think, reason, review, etc.</td>

    <td>Pace/Rate of AI and human</td>
    <td>As compared to people, computers can handle more data at a speedier rate. For occurrence, in the event that the human intellect can solve a math problem in 5 minutes, AI can solve 10 problems in a minute.</td>
    <td>In terms of speed human cannot beat the speed of AI, or, machines.</td>

    <td>Decision Making</td>
    <td>AI is profoundly objective in choice making because it analyzes based on absolutely accumulated data.</td>
    <td>Human’s choices may be affected by subjective components which are not based on figures alone.</td>
